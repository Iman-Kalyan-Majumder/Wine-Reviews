<h1> Wine Reviews </h1>
<h2> The primary objective of this project is Sentiment Analysis using LSTM </h2>
<ul>
<li> According to Wikipedia, LSTM or Long Short Term Memory, is an artificial neural network used in fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. 
Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. 
Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). </li>
<li> In this project, LSTM is used to analyse sentiment through wine reviews and predict whether the wine rating is above 90 or not.</li>
<li> The highest accuracy achieved is around 84%.</li>
<li> This project was developed using a step-by-step tutorial, the link for which is given below.</li>
